This was an educational project for me â€” how could I make something that would take me from zero machine learning knowledge to a postion where I feel confident in my abilities to develop and test models?

I trained this model on 38100 training steps on the FinewebEDU 10BT data set. My loss settled to around 3.1. I then fine-tuned my model on a small dataset that simulated therapy conversations: https://huggingface.co/datasets/jerryjalapeno/nart-100k-synthetic

My fine-tuned model settled to a loss around 1.45, and I'm quite pleased with its performance so far!

This project was designed to be completly educational for myself, so I will be keeping the weights and model offline, but have shared a few simulated conversations I made with it in the repo.

Thanks for reading guys. More projects coming soon :)
